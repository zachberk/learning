Hello world!

Here are useful Git commands I should try to commit to memory:

Commands related to a remote repository:
- git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git (clones repo from GitHub)
- git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context when there are no other branches in directory)

Commands related to the workflow:
- git add . (this adds all edited files in current local directory and susbequent directories to staging area)
- git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different" (committing confirms edits to repo/current directory)

Commands related to checking status or log history
- git status
- git log 

The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
git status is read as git | status | (no destination).

To make a commit with Visual Studio Code as the text editor, just type git commit. After you hit Enter a new tab in VS Code will open for you to write your commit message. You may provide more details on multiple lines as part of your commit message. After typing your commit message, save it Ctrl + S (Mac: Cmd + S) and close the tab. If you return to the command line, you will see your commit message and a summary of your changes.

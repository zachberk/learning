# recipes

This project will be a simple recipe website. By the end of it, I will have practiced coding and using the basic html boilerplate structure, important html elements and attributes (including links and images), and Git commits for best practice team software development.

The major learning is that most online pictures probably have some protection or copyright policies on them so that they can't show up on a website if embedded via their direct URL - I had to download them/screenshot them and embed them via their local paths on my computer.
